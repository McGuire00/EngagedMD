# EngagedMD

# Back-End - Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

# Running in Dev mode
  * Make sure MongoDB and Node.js are installed on your computer. Otherise it will not work.
  * install dependecies (npm install)
  * Start MongoDB Server
  * npm run devStart (to run with nodemon for live updates)

# Improvements
  * Automated tests are a must and I did not include mine because of time. But they are a must.
  * For scaling, I would think more modular and move towards design patterns. No one wants spaghetti code.
  * I would implement more erorr catching
